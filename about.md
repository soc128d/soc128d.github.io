### When?

Mondays and Wednesdays from 1:30-3:00 PM Pacific Time

### Who?

I am Sheridan Stewart, a Ph.D. candidate in the Sociology Department at Stanford University. I am a computational social scientist broadly interested in the relationships amongst beliefs, dispositions, social structure, and behavior. In other words, I am interested not only in what people are like but also what the world is like to them, how that relates to their social origins and social position, and how these things change or are reproduced. In my dissertation, I am approaching these issues through the institution of work in particular, asking what work means to people and how that relates to their positions in society.

You are, so far, a diverse set of students from various programs, at various stages in your educations or careers, and with varied research interests. I'm looking forward to getting to know you and seeing what you uncover once we begin to play around with computational text analysis using Python.

### What and why?

Mining Culture Through Text Data: Introduction to Social Data Science

#### Course Goals and Description
Data science and machine learning have rapidly gained recognition within the social sciences because they offer powerful new ways to ask questions about social and cultural issues. This course will examine how data science has revolutionized how social scientists study culture by providing new tools to analyze patterns in text data in different contexts and at different scales. More specifically, we will explore how these tools can be used to mine the meaning of text from sources such as posts on social media, transcripts of political debates, books, press releases, and more.

This is a hands-on, interactive course culminating in a social data science project designed by the student or a team of up to four students. Most class sessions will be taught interactively using Jupyter Notebooks. Students will follow along with workshop-style lectures by using and modifying the provided Python code in real time to analyze data and visualize results. The course will cover such topics as gender and racial/ethnic stereotypes, workplace discrimination, climate change, and the relationship between lifestyle and political identity. Students will learn to explore text data with tools such as word embeddings, topic models, and sentiment analysis. Students will gain experience with base Python as well as tools from libraries useful for data science such as [``Empath``](https://github.com/Ejhfast/empath-client), [``Gensim``](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/), [``NumPy``](https://numpy.org/), [``Pandas``](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [``scikit-learn``](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), and [``spaCy``](https://spacy.io/).
