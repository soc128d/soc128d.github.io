    "\n",
    "Inferential statistics is all about using what we know about a sampleâ€”including variability in the data, which is a source of uncertaintyâ€”to make inferences about the population from which a sample was drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Benjamin et al. (2018)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0189-z?source=post_page---------------------------) describe the typical approach to inferential statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "> In testing a point null hypothesis H<sub>0</sub> against an alternative hypothesis H<sub>1</sub> based on data x<sub>obs</sub>, the P value is defined as the probability, calculated under the null hypothesis, that a test statistic is as extreme or more extreme than its observed value. The null hypothesis is typically rejected â€” and the finding is declared statistically significant â€” if the P value falls below the (current) [type I error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors) threshold Î± = 0.05.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put differently, a p-value is our attempt to quantify the likelihood that we would observe the data we actually observe (including the test statistic derived from the data) if the null hypothesis were true. A low p-value suggests the likelihood of observing the data should be low *if the null hypothesis is correct*. We typically use a threshold like 0.05 as the cutoff for declaring statistical significance. If the p-value is >= 0.05, we *retain* the null hypothesis; if the p-value is < 0.05, we *reject* the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also refer to the 95% confience level (1 - 0.05) when Î± = 0.05. This is the conventional threshold, but Benjamin et al. (2018) argue against this for various reasons. [Consider this XKCD comic](https://xkcd.com/882/), for example.\n",

    "#### Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation refers to the strength and direction of the (potential) relationship between two variables. Usually, we assume this relationship is pretty much linear. A positive correlation coefficient indicates that when one variable increases, the other does, too. A negative correlation implies that as one variable increases, the other instead decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation is sometimes considered to be part of descriptive statistics because correlation coefficients *describe* the strength of a relationship between two variabies. However, when we calculate a correlation coefficient, we also typically performance a hypothesis test, which is part of inferential statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we calculate the correlation coefficient between two continuous variables, our null hypothesis is that the correlation is 0 (i.e., that the variables are uncorrelated). A significant correlation coefficient suggests the variables are correlated at some confidence level (determined by the p-value)."

    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "For each tier increase in the measure of the restaurant's price range, we would expect the <tt>compound</tt> sentiment score of a review to increase by 0.088 on average according to Model 1 or by 0.062 on average according to Model 2, net of the other variables in each model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Serving breakfast is associated with an increase in the <tt>compound</tt> sentiment score of approximately 0.039 (Model 1) or 0.031 (Model 2), net of the other variables in each model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Businesses characterized as having a \"classy\" ambience score 0.073 higher on the <tt>compound</tt> score of sentiment on average, net of price and whether or not the business serves breakfast.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on a comparison of the coefficients in these two models, it appears that controlling for whether a restaurant is categorized as <tt>classy</tt> accounts for some of the association between the outcome and the other independent variables. For example, the coefficient on price decreases from 0.088 to 0.062 when we control for <tt>classy</tt>. This could be interpreted in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, classiness may be associated both with higher prices and with factors that lead to more positive reviews (i.e., higher <tt>compound</tt> scores). This would be an example of confounding. Alternatively, it may be that higher prices make a restaurant seem more classy, which in turn leads to more positive reviews. This would be an example of partial mediation, and there are more formal ways to test for this. The larger point is that this is observational data and as much as we may like to offer causal interpretations, we can't be certain. Our job when using tools like linear regression is to come up with the best hypothesis we can, motivated by the best theory, and then use our models (and the results of significance tests) as components of an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "In OLS, each coefficient is being tested using the null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>) that the coefficient is equal to zero. A significant coefficient on any of the independent variables indicates we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the two variables are related in some way. The coefficient quantifies the strength of that relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that both the R<sup>2</sup> and Adjusted R<sup>2</sup> increase from Model 1 to Model 2. The R<sup>2</sup> is a measure of how much variance in the outcome is explained by the independent (or explanatory) variables. This tends to increase if we add additional independent variables. The adjusted R<sup>2</sup> is penalized for each additional variable, so it is slightly lower the plain R<sup>2</sup> in Model 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **crucial point** with this kind of statistical modeling is that we ultimately should not care much about the R<sup>2</sup> or Adjusted R<sup>2</sup>. If we are interested in the relationship between some variable x and another variable y, we want to include additional variables only if we expect that they confound the relationship (i.e., have an effect on both x and y) or, more generally, are a source of [omitted-variable bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omitted-variable_bias). If you want a deeper dive into these issues, see [this paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0049124118782542), although it is a reply to a comment on another paper, so a lot of the original context won't be immediately clear."

    "Whereas inferential statistics is concerned with generalizing from a sample to a population by quantifying uncertainty, and we often want to know about the relationship between two specific variables net of any potential confounders, that's all (usually) beside the point in supervised machine learning. We want to train models that predict outcomes well, regardless of the substantive importance of the relationship in question. Confounding is no longer an issueâ€“we just want to predict the outcome well and in a way that generalizes to unseen data.\n",

The two biggest categories of machine learning are *regression* (predicting continuous outcomes, like income or ratings) and *classification* (predicting membership in a category). We used OLS for linear regression in the inferential statistics section, and we can use OLS for supervised machine learning as well. Further, we used logistic regression for inferential statistics, and we can use it for classification tasks in the context of supervised machine learning.\n",
