    "## Sentiment Analysis and Dictionary Methods using `Empath`\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is a broad topic, and we will revisit it later. In this notebook, we will focus on dictionary methods, which offer one approach to sentiment analysis as well as offering analyses beyond sentiment. Dictionary methods are among the most straightforward of methods for computational text analysis. A \"dictionary\" or \"lexicon\" in this sense is a list of words that we have decided in advance are related to a given topic, or \"lexical category,\" like positive sentiment. To use these dictionaries, we count the words in a given document that are in that dictionary, often taking into account that longer documents aren't necessarily more positive or negative in a meaningful way by virtue of having more words. If we have a list of positive words and a list of negative words, and more words from the first list are in a document, we might say the document is positive. (Sentiment analysis is not restricted to dictionary methods, but that's where we'll start.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will learn to use dictionary methods for sentiment analysis and for more general exploration of topics in social media posts using `pandas`, `seaborn`, and Python's [`Empath` library](https://github.com/Ejhfast/empath-client). You can read more about this library in the original paper [here](https://hci.stanford.edu/publications/2016/ethan/empath-chi-2016.pdf). Researchers commonly use paid sets of dictionaries like those available from [LIWC](https://liwc.wpengine.com/). However, the original paper behind `Empath` suggests that similar categories are correlated with LIWC. `Empath` offers 194 lexical categories in total—and it's free! Another benefit is the ease of creating custom dictionaries. To do this, you simply provide a set of \"seed words\" (i.e., words to \"seed\" or begin your category), and `Empath` will identify similar words to fill out the dictionary for you. (We'll talk more about how that works later.)\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "We will consider a few ways to use dictionary methods to analyze social processes. To do this, we're going to use a corpus of posts to Reddit's r/jobs message board between January 1 and December 31, 2020. Specifically, we will consider relationships like the following:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>how and when people interact with social media (time of day, day of week)</li>\n",
    "    <li>how time relates to content and engagement (e.g., the number of replies or upvotes)\n",
    "    <li>the relationship between content and engagement</li>\n",
    "    <li>relationships among different types of content (specifically, lexical categories, including sentiment)</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, we will consider how these relate to **social processes** and **social institutions**. The concept of a *social insitution* has been defined many ways. Consider, for instance, Granovetter's characterization of social institutions in *Society and Economy* (2017: p. 171): \"patterns of ideas or norms that influence but only incompletely determine how actors approach the problems they mean to solve.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard work day and standard work week are norms that exert considerable influence on the organization of social life. It makes sense that people working a standard schedule might feel a bit buoyed on the weekend. But what about people who work different hours, or who aren't working at all during a given period of time? [Young and Lim (2014)](https://sociologicalscience.com/time-network-good/) find that both working and unemployed individuals experience similar changes in subjective wellbeing throughout the course of the week. Despite the fact that unemployed individuals are not working during the work week, *both* groups report greater wellbeing on weekends. Young and Lim argue that how people experience the rhythm of the week depends on the availability of other people as much as it does on just having time to do things (roughly speaking). That extends to the opportunities that exist based on formal and informal sanctions. Think about how opportunties are shaped by the day of the week. Places of business are often open later on weekends, for example. Now consider how our time-based expectations become entrenched and moralized. To take one example, people who do shift work often get judged for having a drink after work when \"after work\" is early in the morning, which is generally seen as an inappropriate time to drink.\n",
    "\n",
    "We might also use these data to ask questions like whether users writing about a certain topic also tend to write about another topic or set of topics, and we can come up with hypotheses for why we might observe certain associations.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will import the libraries we need for the analyses we'll run. You may need to install `Empath` and download the language model for spaCy. You can run the following lines to do so. The `!` tells Jupyter you want to execute commands as if you were using the command line (or terminal)."

    "I pulled ~150 posts to Reddit's r/jobs community per day from [pushshift.io](https://pushshift.io/)'s API for each day in 2020. Many thanks for the work they do to make data available! I have cleaned this corpus a bit already, although it is far from perfect and we will still stuff like markdown containing links. It includes 49,872 posts in total. The metadata/variables associated wih the text include the submission's score (\"karma\" or \"upvotes\" in Reddit parlance), the number of replies the post received, the title of the submission, the text of the submission, and various markers of time. Specifically, I have included the date and separate variables for the day of the month (1-31), the day of the week (as integers 0-6 and strings \"Sunday\" to \"Monday\"), day of the year (1-366, as it was a leap year!), week of the year, and the hour of the day (0-23). It is important to note that Reddit attracts an international audience, so the time of day (and, to an extent, the day itself) may be relative to Pushshift, not to each individual user. Although Reddit allows for relative anonymity through the use of usernames/handles, I have provided an ID field (\"author_id\") in place of the username of the author."

    "### Standardizing Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into the rest of our analyses, we are going to \"standardize\" the variables. If you have some background in statistics, this may be familiar: we subtract the mean of a variable from each value and divide by the standard deviation, which is the same as calculating a [z-score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-score). This sets the mean of the variable to zero and the standard deviation to one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardizing variables offers two major advantages that are relevant to this class. First, sometimes variables are just difficult to interpret. Have you ever been asked whether you agree or disagree with a statement on a scale of 1-7 (or 1-5, or 0-100)? What would it mean to say that the difference between two groups is 0.24 on that 1-7 scale? Often, psychologists and others standardize variables so that differences have a more straightforward interpretation. This interpretation is that a difference is some fraction of a standard deviation. Put differently, we can discuss the magnitude of a difference with respect to how much variance is in the data. Is the difference large, considering how much the data vary in general? When analyzing the results of an experiment, a psychologist might say that the treatment has an effect on the outcome of 0.4 standard deviations. That's pretty opaque—but many people find it more intuitive than saying the effect is 0.24 out of seven.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second and most immediately obvious advantage is that we can plot standardized variables at the same time. Examine the two plots below. The first plot includes unstandardized variables. If we were to look at any one of these variables, we may see more ups and downs, but the additional variables change the scale of the y-axis. This means we have zoomed out, so the ups and downs are more difficult to see. (Whether the ups and downs matter is another question, and we'll talk more about this!)"

    "`Empath` makes creating dictionaries for different lexical categories fairly straightforward on the surface. Beneath the surface, it uses some pretty powerful tools. We'll learn about these tools (such as word embeddings) later in the class. For now, all we need to know is that we can provide a small list of words related to our chosen topic and `Empath` will give us a longer list of related words. We can use that list as our lexicon.\n",

The <tt>model=\"reddit\"</tt> argument means we will find words that are related based on how language is (was) used in Reddit data when `Empath` was created. The alternatives are based on the New York Times and a collection of fiction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: we will talk a LOT more about word embeddings and vector space models in the future, and you will learn how they are used to generate collections of words like the following. The TL;DR is that these tools assume words are \"similar\" if they are used in similar contexts. This assumption can make it easy to find synonyms, but sometimes tools based on this assumption will think _antonyms_ are highly \"similar\" in this specific sense. These tools can also reflect social prejudices, which can make them useful for studying those issues (as we will later in the course) but may be a bit of a surprise. **Debiasing** word embeddings and other tools is also an active area of research, and we will discuss that more.\n",
