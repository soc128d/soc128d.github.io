Welcome to the unofficial official course site for Sociology 128D. I will use this site to share the Jupyter Notebooks we use in class, but *we* can use this site as a way to show off your work. The [blog](https://soc128d.github.io/blog.md) is currently non-existent, but you can add to it over the course of the quarter as you improve your skills with Python, text analysis, and thinking like a social scientist.
