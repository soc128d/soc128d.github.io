    "#### A quick note about this notebook versus subsequent notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, this class is meant to be a bit like a series of workshops, many of which could be self-contained. If you feel a bit lost amid all the code, that's okay--and if this all strikes you as incredibly basic, that's okay, too! Subsequent notebooks will use various methods to analyze a corpus in a way that can produce sociologically-interesting knowledge. These notebooks will be accessible even if you don't feel confident in your ability to follow the code because the focus won't be on the coding. The notebooks should also be interesting even if the code seems pretty basic to you because we'll be looking at applications to social research.\n",

    "#### A quick note about this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll begin to look at how to use libraries like `pandas` to manage and manipulate text. We'll also build toward different ways of quantifying information about documents and visualizing the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is only the second notebook, and this is all preliminary material. From here, we'll move on to measures like TF-IDF that can be used for information retrieval (e.g., search engines) and measuring document similarity, which has all sorts of applications in the social sciences. TF-IDF is also a jumping off point for other measures we'll consider, including dense vector representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have an initial go at using `pandas` with a dataset of tweets from January 6, 2021. You can download the dataset from Kaggle at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/mrmorj/capitol-riot-tweets). Just unzip/extract the archive and place the CSV in the same directory as this notebook (or edit the `f = \"...\"` line in the following cell to include the file path)."

Put one way, there is a negative correlation between the rank of a word (where 1 = most frequent) and its frequency.\n",

If we count up the occurrences of each word in this column, it's the same as going through each row and checking whether the type occurs at least once. In other words, this helps us count the number of documents in which each word occurs. There are other ways to do this, of course, and later we'll see that we can use libraries like `scikit-learn` to do this more quickly."

If we iterate through the words in each tweet, we can find out which strings *contain* \"capitol\" but aren't themselves instances of the *type* \"capitol.\""

These tools and skills will also transfer to other areas, so don't worry if studying culture isn't 100% your bag!"
